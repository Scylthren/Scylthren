- Howdy I'm @Scylthren.
- I’m interested in a variety of things but mostly D&D, learning to code, and reading.
- I’m currently learning how to use HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript in order to create a website that I can be proud of. I am also learning some basic Java for future coding purposes.
- I’m not currently looking to collaborate on anything as I'm just starting out and want to get my feet under me before any collaborating.
- I can be reached through email: arcnoah31@gmail.com, or through Discord: Scylthren#6598
